# Secrets Web App
Simplfied Whisper App clone, deployed [here](https://quiet-wave-88262.herokuapp.com/) with Heroku:
- Front-end: EJS/JS, Bootstrap
- Back-end: Express with Node.js, MongoDB
- Other: Authentication with Google OAuth

**What I enjoyed while building this app:** The structured way that each save point considered a different authentication method and built layers of security. It was also really exciting to use Google Cloud developer tools and APIs to build out the OAuth process.  

**What I struggled with while building this app:** The deployment -- I made some pretty critical mistakes when pushing to git and deploying, but I definitely learned from every error (especially after completely breaking my code at one point). 

**Things I learned through building this app:** Understanding git is an absolutely essential component of effective web development. Having effective branches and commits is really helpful, and having tangled branches, or not understanding what branch you're commit on before you do so just leads to a huge mess that's really difficult to untangle, especially if you're only one person working on the project.
